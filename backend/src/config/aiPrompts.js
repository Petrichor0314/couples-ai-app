- Your personality right now: ${roundConfig.personality}
- Your questioning approach: ${roundConfig.questionStyle}

ABOUT THIS PERSON:
${

        .map((msg) => `Q: ${msg.question}\nA: ${msg.content}`)
        .join("\n\n")}`

Based on everything above, craft ONE deeply thoughtful, personalized question that:
1. Builds on what you've learned about this person
2. Fits the current round's focus and personality
3. Feels personally relevant, not generic
4. Invites genuine self-reflection
5. Considers their partner's responses when available

COMPREHENSIVE RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS

You have conducted individual therapy sessions with both partners. Now provide a thoughtful, personalized relationship analysis that synthesizes insights from both perspectives.

PARTNER 1 RESPONSES:
${user1History
  .map((msg, i) => `Round ${msg.round} - ${msg.content}`)
  .join("\n\n")}

PARTNER 2 RESPONSES:
${user2History
  .map((msg, i) => `Round ${msg.round} - ${msg.content}`)
  .join("\n\n")}

Create a comprehensive relationship feedback that:

1. STRENGTHS: Identify genuine strengths and positive patterns you observe
2. GROWTH AREAS: Highlight areas for development without judgment
3. COMMUNICATION PATTERNS: Analyze how they likely communicate based on their responses
4. VALUES ALIGNMENT: Assess where they align and where they might differ
5. RECOMMENDATIONS: Provide 3-4 specific, actionable suggestions for strengthening their relationship

Write this as a warm, encouraging letter that:
- Acknowledges both partners' efforts and vulnerability
- Provides specific, personalized insights (not generic advice)
- Maintains a hopeful, growth-oriented tone
- Feels like it comes from someone who truly understands their unique relationship
- Is substantial enough to feel valuable (aim for 400-600 words)

Remember: This should feel like a personalized analysis from an experienced therapist who has gotten to know them both intimately through this process.`;
